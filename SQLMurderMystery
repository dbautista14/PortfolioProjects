A crime has taken place and the detective needs your help. The detective gave you the crime scene report, but you somehow lost it. 
You vaguely remember that the crime was a murder that occurred sometime on Jan.15, 2018 and that it took place in SQL City. 
Start by retrieving the corresponding crime scene report from the police departmentâ€™s database. 


select description
from crime_scene_report
where date = '20180115' and type = 'murder' and city = 'SQL City';

-- Security footage shows that there were 2 witnesses. The first witness lives at the last house on "Northwestern Dr". 
The second witness, named Annabel, lives somewhere on "Franklin Ave".

select id, name
from person
where address_street_name = 'Northwestern Dr'
order by address_number desc limit 1;
-- we are assuming that the highest address number is the last house

-- We get 14887	Morty Schapiro


select id, name
from person
where address_street_name = 'Franklin Ave'
and name like 'Annabel%';

-- we get 16371 Annabel Miller
-- we can now use the id to retrieve each witnesses statement

select transcript
from interview
where person_id in (14887, 16371)

-- I heard a gunshot and then saw a man run out. He had a "Get Fit Now Gym" bag. The membership number on the bag started with "48Z".
Only gold members have those bags. The man got into a car with a plate that included "H42W".
-- I saw the murder happen, and I recognized the killer from my gym when I was working out last week on January the 9th.

-- With this info we can possibly find the killer

-- Following the first clue

select person.name 
from get_fit_now_member 
join person 
on get_fit_now_member.person_id = person.id 
join drivers_license 
on person.license_id = drivers_license.id 
where membership_status = 'gold' 
and get_fit_now_member.id like '48Z%' 
and plate_number like '%H42W%';

-- We get a name, Jeremy Bowers. We can stop here or we can see if Bowers had something to say

select transcript
from interview
join person 
on person.id = interview.person_id 
where name = 'Jeremy Bowers';

-- We find that Bowers was actually hired by a woman.
'I was hired by a woman with a lot of money. I don't know her name but I know she's around 5'5" (65") or 5'7" (67"). 
She has red hair and she drives a Tesla Model S. I know that she attended the SQL Symphony Concert 3 times in December 2017. '


select name from person
join facebook_event_checkin on person.id = facebook_event_checkin.person_id 
join drivers_license on person.license_id = drivers_license.id
where event_name = 'SQL Symphony Concert' 
and date like '201712%' 
and car_make = 'Tesla'
and car_model = 'Model S' 
and height between 65 and 67 
and hair_color = 'red' 
and gender='female'
group by person.id having count(*) == 3 

-- We got a name! Miranda Priestly

-- Did we find the killer?
INSERT INTO solution VALUES (1, 'Miranda Priestly');
        
        SELECT value FROM solution;

-- Congrats, you found the brains behind the murder! Everyone in SQL City hails you as the greatest SQL detective of all time. 
Time to break out the champagne!
